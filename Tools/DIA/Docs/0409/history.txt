	- Fixed overlay objects, if the number of tabs on one line was less than the total number of tabs.
	+ On the Tools menu - Added new item "Update information on all packages.
	  Which causes the system to initialize the search for new devices, then the program collects data and updates the data on all packages.
	  This functionality can help when, after installing the drivers, the system could be new devices, but the program they are not yet aware, and therefore offers no drivers for installation.
	* In the default settings:
	   for 1 tabs [OS_1] display values:
	   	Ver = 5.0; 5.1; 5.2
	     instead:
	   	Ver = 5.1; 5.2
	   for 3 tabs [OS_3] exhibited values:
	   	Ver = 6.0; 6.1
	   	Name = Vista\7\Server 2008\Server 2008 R2 x64
	     instead:
	   	Ver = 6.0
	   	Name = Vista x64
	  For those who use the default program settings, it is recommended to delete the file Settings.ini and run the program again.
	* On the main form of control is replaced by Checkbox, for better readability and to correct errors display on some systems.
	+ When you save the program settings, you are prompted to restart the program.
