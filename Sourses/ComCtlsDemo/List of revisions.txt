  Also expanded the description of the property to advice following:
  - A value of -1 or 0 indicates that any width is allowed.
  - When set to -1 the text will be always single lined.

  Also with this change there is no problem anymore in a potential OCX when it was compiled with "binary compatibility".
- Improved the ToolBar control at design time. (WS_EX_TRANSPARENT added at design time)
  As the BackColor property is anyhow ignored at design time this ensures that no "black" background is drawn.
