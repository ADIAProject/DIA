  Example: 'Set TreeView1.Nodes(1).Tag = TreeView1.Object' (Though TreeView1 without '.Object' is allowed)

28-May-2016

21-May-2016
- Included the NodeBeforeSelect event in the TreeView control.

  When updating, please replace all components. (e.g. RichTextBoxBase.bas)

16-May-2016
- Improved the Expanded property of a Node in the TreeView control. It works now like in the original MS control.
  It is now ensured that BeforeCollapse/BeforeExpand and Collapse/Expand events are always fired when state is being changed.
  Also it is now possible to set the expanded state even when there are no child items associated.
- To support large numbers the Children property of a Node returns now 'Long' instead of 'Integer' in the TreeView control.

- It is now possible to pass a Node object in the Relative parameter in Nodes.Add and Node.Move in the TreeView control.
- Removed the error message 'the size of the selected picture is not compatible' in the Images property page of the ImageList control.
  So at design time it is now allowed to select different sized pictures. At run time it was already allowed.
  The original MS control allows it also. So such error message was a unnecessary limitation.

12-May-2016
- Fixed a bug in the Move method of a Node and some other internal improvements in the TreeView control.
  Bugs were in relation to the new ExpandedImage property of a Node.

  This Error is also raised in the original MS control.

04-May-2016
- The Change event is now also fired when value was changed by code in the DTPicker control.
  Though in the original MS control it is only raised when value was changed by user.
  But that makes actually no sense and might be even a bug in the original MS control.

15-Apr-2016
- Minor adjustment to the BackColor in the StatusBar control so that the Pager control can recognize it.

31-Mar-2016
- Minor bugfix in the internal Numeric/Currency/Date sorting functions in the ListView control.

01-Mar-2016
- Bugfixes and improvements for vertical ToolBar control. (Align property set to vbAlignLeft or vbAlignRight)
  The Vertical ToolBar behaves now like the original MS control when the Wrappable property is set to False.
  Also changing from horizontal to vertical and vice versa after initialization works now properly.

29-Feb-2016
- All controls are now "DPI Aware". (concerns exotic DPI or very large DPI, e.g. 113% and 200%)
- ComboBoxW with Style 'CboStyleDropDownCombo' is now working on Windows 2000.
  Message CB_GETCOMBOBOXINFO is not supported on Windows 2000, so little workaround was necessary to solve this.

25-Feb-2016
- Minor adjustment to the BackColor in the ToolBar control so that the Pager control can recognize it.

24-Feb-2016

- Included the ShowTrailingDates property in the MonthView control.
- Included the CalendarShowTrailingDates property in the DTPicker control.
- Forgot to rename the HotTrack property to 'HotTracking' in the property page of the SpinBox control.

28-Jan-2016
- Fixed a bug in the LVN_ITEMACTIVATE handler in the ListView control.
  The Shift parameter in the ItemActivate event was not properly set.

19-Jan-2016
- Renamed the HotTrack property to 'HotTracking' in the SpinBox control.
  So the wording is in line with the UpDown, TreeView, TabStrip, ListView and LinkLabel control.

07-Jan-2016
- Included the MaxText event in the TextBoxW and RichTextBox control.

01-Jan-2016
- Mouse events now again in correct order in the ImageCombo, TreeView and ListView control.
  Some workaround was necessary to raise them 'After' (refer to update 21-Nov-2015) and keep correct order.
  Issue was an internal modal message loop on these controls. (DragDetect)

[...]

11-Nov-2012
- First release.
