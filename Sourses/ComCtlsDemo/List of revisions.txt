- Two bugfixes in the SelPrint and PrintDoc methods in the RichtTextBox control.
  - RightMargin/BottomMargin were added to the printable area instead deducted.
  - The printable area was not converted from device units to twips. (the paper area was not wrong)

09-Feb-2017

21-Jan-2017
- Fixed a bug that the item's checkboxes/options were not drawn grayed in a disabled non-standard Style ListBoxW control.
  On update from 18-Oct-2016 was only the text fixed to drawn grayed in that case, but not the button itself.

- Two minor bugfixes in the ListBoxW control.
  - Direct clicking the checkbox (Checkbox Style and MultiColumn set to True) was not possible when not selected before. (behavior bug)
  - If both RightToLeft and MultiColumn are set True the top index goes negative and everything is unpredictable and unstable. (MS bug?)

- Improved the Expanded property of a Node in the TreeView control. It works now like in the original MS control.
  It is now ensured that BeforeCollapse/BeforeExpand and Collapse/Expand events are always fired when state is being changed.

04-May-2016
- The Change event is now also fired when value was changed by code in the DTPicker control.

  But that makes actually no sense and might be even a bug in the original MS control.

15-Apr-2016
- Minor adjustment to the BackColor in the StatusBar control so that the Pager control can recognize it.

31-Mar-2016
- Minor bugfix in the internal Numeric/Currency/Date sorting functions in the ListView control.

  The Vertical ToolBar behaves now like the original MS control when the Wrappable property is set to False.
  Also changing from horizontal to vertical and vice versa after initialization works now properly.

29-Feb-2016
- All controls are now "DPI Aware". (concerns exotic DPI or very large DPI, e.g. 113% and 200%)
- ComboBoxW with Style 'CboStyleDropDownCombo' is now working on Windows 2000.

  The Shift parameter in the ItemActivate event was not properly set.

  So the wording is in line with the UpDown, TreeView, TabStrip, ListView and LinkLabel control.

07-Jan-2016
- Included the MaxText event in the TextBoxW and RichTextBox control.

01-Jan-2016
- Mouse events now again in correct order in the ImageCombo, TreeView and ListView control.

  Issue was an internal modal message loop on these controls. (DragDetect)

[...]

11-Nov-2012
- First release.
