11-Feb-2015
- Fixed a bug in the auto sizing in the LabelW control.
- Included the ContextMenu event in the Slider control.
- Removed the ToolTip control.

19-Jan-2015
- Some enhancements and modifications are done in the CommonDialog class:
  - Removed the function 'ShowOpenWith' as it does not fit into the concept.
    Because the open with dialog works as a execution and not like the others as a user input.
  - Renamed the function 'ShowFolder' to 'ShowFolderBrowser'.
  - Included the constants CdlCFApply, CdlBIFValidate and CdlBIFStatusText.
  - Included the events InitDialog, FileValidate, ColorValidate, FontApply and FolderBrowserValidateFailed.
  - Included the property 'HookEvents'. (indicates if the dialog box can raise events that requires a hook callback)
  - The folder browser dialog (if CdlBIFBrowseIncludeFiles flag is set) will now also set the FileOffset property, if necessary.
    The RootFolder is now a property and not a optional argument of the folder browser dialog function anymore.
    The OK button is now disabled (CdlBIFReturnOnlyFSDirs flag must be set) if the user selects a "\\ServerName" item. (SHGetPathFromIDList API fails)
  - The page min margins are now as properties and not as optional arguments of the page setup dialog function anymore.
  - The Font object property is removed and replaced with the underlying properties.
    The FontName property is for example now by default empty, as it is not dependent on a object anymore.
    This enables a more appropriate use of the font dialog. This way is the same as in the original CommonDialog control from MS.
  - The find and replace dialog uses now a WH_GETMESSAGE hook instead of a WH_KEYBOARD hook. (more reliable/compact; PostMessage API can now be used)
- Some other minor improvements.

29-Dec-2014
- The behavior of the Text property in the ListBoxW and ComboBoxW control is now equal to the original controls from MS.

- Included the ColumnOrder run time property in the ListView control.

20-Dec-2014
- Fixed a bug that the tool tips did not display correctly when using comctl32.dll version 5.8x.
  Reason is that multiline tool tips (TTM_SETMAXTIPWIDTH with value 0) are only supported in comctl32.dll version 6.0 or higher.
- Certain property bags will not crash anymore when migrating from the MS controls.
- Included the DTFormat property of a panel in the StatusBar control.

02-Nov-2014
- On WinXP (but only when IDE uses comctl32.dll version 6.0) there were on some property pages
  black backgrounds on those CommandButton controls that were placed on a Frame control. (Known WinXP bug)

  It isn't in the Std-EXE project as this would be completly unnecessary.

12-Oct-2014

  With this bitmap pictures can be inserted into by code. (e.g. from a StdPicture or the .Image property of a PictureBox)

- Fixed a bug that the MaxTipWidth property did not work as expected in the ToolTip control.
  Also expanded the description of the property to advice following:
  - A value of -1 or 0 indicates that any width is allowed.
  - When set to -1 the text will be always single lined.

07-Jul-2014

05-Jul-2014
- Included the DrawMode property in the ComboBoxW and ListBoxW control.

  Also with this change there is no problem anymore in a potential OCX when it was compiled with "binary compatibility".
- Improved the ToolBar control at design time. (WS_EX_TRANSPARENT added at design time)
  As the BackColor property is anyhow ignored at design time this ensures that no "black" background is drawn.
  This happened for instance when the IDE (VB6.EXE) uses the comctl32.dll version 6.0 or higher.
