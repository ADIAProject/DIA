    'Remarks  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    'The SEE_MASK_NOASYNC flag must be specified if the thread calling ShellExecuteEx does not
    'have a message loop or if the thread or process will terminate soon after ShellExecuteEx
    'returns. Under such conditions, the calling thread will not be available to complete the
    'DDE conversation, so it is important that ShellExecuteEx complete the conversation before
    'returning control to the calling application. Failure to complete the conversation can
    'result in an unsuccessful launch of the document.
    'If the calling thread has a message loop and will exist for some time after the call to
    'ShellExecuteEx returns, the SEE_MASK_NOASYNC flag is optional. If the flag is omitted,
    'the calling thread's message pump will be used to complete the DDE conversation. The
    'calling application regains control sooner, since the DDE conversation can be completed
    'in the background.
    'When populating the most frequently used program list using the SEE_MASK_FLAG_LOG_USAGE
    'flag in fMask, counts are made differently for the classic and Windows XP-style Start
    'menus. The classic style menu only counts hits to the shortcuts in the Program menu. The
    'Windows XP-style menu counts both hits to the shortcuts in the Program menu and hits to
    'those shortcuts' targets outside of the Program menu. Therefore, setting lpFile to
    'myfile.exe would affect the count for the Windows XP-style menu regardless of whether
    'that file was launched directly or through a shortcut. The classic style Ќ which would
    'require lpFile to contain a .lnk file name Ќ would not be affected.
    'To include double quotation marks in lpParameters, enclose each mark in a pair of
    'quotation marks, as in the following example.
    '    sei.lpParameters = "An example: \"\"\"quoted text\"\"\"";
    'In this case, the application receives three parameters: An, example:, and "quoted text".
