These shellsort algorithms can reasonably be relied upon to perform
without error provided they are used correctly and are still in their
original state, as they have been exhaustively tested (this morning)
and produce valid output and cannot crash, corrupt your data or
operating system, or break off your cpu registers.

However, as you are free to use and distribute the source and binary,
in its original or modified state, by doing so you agree to accept the
full risk.

Happy sorting, Rd :)
