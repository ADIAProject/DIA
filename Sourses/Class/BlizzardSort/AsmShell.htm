<h1><u>Accelerated ShellSort algorithm</u></h1>

<blockquote><tt>

This shell algorithm is founded on a very solid performer that was originally developed by vb2themax, and optimized further by several very talented coders, before I twisted a little more out of it in this low-level version.

<br /><br />

This algorithm is unbelievably optimized and is a solid performer on all data with no known weaknesses.
